# Pipeline Features - Completed

**Status:** All planned pipeline features have been implemented.

**Details:**

1. **Custom Icons for Pipeline States:**
    * Created SVG icons for all relevant pipeline states (e.g., success, failed, running, canceled, partial, notStarted, unknown, config, disconnected, noBuild, error).
    * Implemented an `IconManager` service (`src/services/iconManager.ts`) to load, cache, and provide these icons as base64 data URLs.
    * Integrated the `IconManager` into the `PipelineMonitor` action (`src/actions/pipelineMonitor.ts`) to display these custom icons on the Stream Deck button, replacing or supplementing the previous state/title-based feedback.

2. **Pipeline Trigger Action:**
    * Added a `queuePipelineRun` method to the `AzureDevOpsClient` (`src/services/azureDevOpsClient.ts`) to initiate pipeline builds.
    * Created a new `PipelineTrigger` action (`src/actions/pipelineTrigger.ts`) with the UUID `com.sshadows.azure-devops-manager.pipeline-trigger`.
    * This action allows users to:
        * Select a project and pipeline to trigger.
        * Optionally specify a branch to build.
        * Configure whether to show a confirmation step before triggering.
        * Configure whether to open the build page in a browser after triggering.
    * The action provides visual feedback on the button for states like "Ready to Trigger", "Confirm", "Triggering...", "Success", "Error", "Setup Required", and "Disconnected".
    * Created a new Property Inspector HTML file (`com.sshadows.azure-devops-manager.sdPlugin/ui/pipelineTrigger.html`) for configuring this action, similar in structure to the `pipelineMonitor.html`.
    * Registered the new action in `src/plugin.ts` and added its definition to `com.sshadows.azure-devops-manager.sdPlugin/manifest.json`.
    * Updated `src/types/settings.ts` to include `IPipelineTriggerSettings` and `defaultPipelineTriggerSettings`.

3. **Pipeline Detail View Enhancement (for PipelineMonitor):**
    * Enhanced the `onKeyDown` event in the `PipelineMonitor` action.
    * When the button is pressed, it now attempts to open the URL of the *latest run* of the monitored pipeline.
    * Added a `getLatestPipelineRunUrl` method to `AzureDevOpsClient` for this purpose.
    * If no runs exist for the pipeline, it falls back to opening the pipeline's definition page.
    * Utilized a new private `openUrl` method (using `child_process.exec` for cross-platform compatibility) in `PipelineMonitor` to open URLs.

4. **Notification Support (for PipelineMonitor):**
    * The `PipelineMonitor` action already included settings (`showNotifications`) and basic logging for status changes. This was verified and deemed sufficient for the current scope.

**Files Modified/Created:**

* `src/actions/pipelineMonitor.ts` (Updated)
* `src/actions/pipelineTrigger.ts` (New)

* `com.sshadows.azure-devops-manager.sdPlugin/imgs/pipeline/` (New directory with SVG icons: `success.svg`, `failed.svg`, `running.svg`, `canceled.svg`, `partial.svg`, `notStarted.svg`, `unknown.svg`, `config.svg`, `disconnected.svg`, `nobuild.svg`, `error.svg`)

# Pull Request Features - Completed

**Status:** The planned Pull Request features have been implemented.

**Details:**

1. **Enhanced PR Tracker Button Actions:**
    * Improved the `onKeyDown` functionality in `PullRequestTracker` to open relevant PR lists when clicked
    * Added support for repository-specific PR links when a specific repository is selected
    * Implemented fallback to project-level PR views when repository details are unavailable
    * Added robust error handling with visual feedback when URL opening fails

2. **URL Generation Service Enhancement:**
    * Added a new `getPullRequestListUrl` method to `AzureDevOpsClient` to generate appropriate PR list URLs
    * This method encapsulates the URL generation logic for better maintainability and consistent behavior
    * The method supports both project-wide PR lists and repository-specific PR lists
    * URL generation follows Azure DevOps URL patterns for reliable navigation

3. **Comprehensive Testing:**
    * Updated tests for the `PullRequestTracker` to fully cover the new functionality
    * Added specific tests for the URL generation logic in different scenarios
    * Ensured high test coverage for the `onKeyDown` implementation
    * Verified proper handling of edge cases (API errors, repository not found, etc.)

**Files Modified:**

* `src/actions/pullRequestTracker.ts` - Enhanced the `onKeyDown` method to use URL generation and improved error handling
* `src/services/azureDevOpsClient.ts` - Added the `getPullRequestListUrl` method for consistent URL generation
* `src/actions/__tests__/pullRequestTracker.test.ts` - Updated and expanded tests to cover new functionality

**Next Steps:**

* Consider implementing additional PR features:
  * PR approval/rejection directly from Stream Deck buttons
  * Detailed PR information display (reviewer status, build status)
  * PR creation shortcuts
* Update documentation with user guides for the implemented features

# Code Quality Improvements - Completed

**Status:** Major code quality issues have been addressed and all linting warnings/errors are resolved.

**Details:**

1. **Test Quality Improvements:**
   * Fixed conditional `expect` calls in test files by restructuring tests to use proper Jest patterns
   * Replaced generic `any` type annotations with specific typed interfaces in test files
   * Fixed unused variables and parameters by removing them or prefixing with underscores
   * Improved test assertions to follow Jest best practices
   * Enhanced error handling patterns in test files

2. **Logging Standardization:**
   * Replaced all `console.log` and `console.error` calls in production code with `streamDeck.logger` methods
   * Added appropriate ESLint disable comments for necessary console statements in test files
   * Implemented consistent logging patterns as documented in the system patterns
   * Enhanced error diagnostics with better structured logging

3. **Documentation Improvements:**
   * Fixed markdown formatting issues across documentation files
   * Added missing top-level headings
   * Corrected list marker spacing for consistency
   * Ensured proper blank lines around headings and lists
   * Removed trailing spaces
   * Enhanced readability and consistency of documentation
