## Known Issues

- No localization support
- Pipeline Monitor needs custom icons for different states

## Development Timeline

- **May 13, 2025 Evening**: Property Inspector Implementation
  - Designed and implemented Property Inspector UI for Pipeline Monitor
  - Implemented bidirectional communication between UI and plugin
  - Added selection of projects and pipelines with dynamic loading
  - Enhanced action to handle settings changes from the UI
  - Updated unit tests to cover new functionality
  - Added error handling for API failures and disconnected states
  - Integrated UI with the plugin's settings management
  - Achieved >92% code coverage for the PipelineMonitor action
  - Added "Edit Connection" button for modifying connection settings after setup
  - Enhanced connection testing with visual feedback and status indicators
  - Replaced console logging with Stream Deck's logger for better diagnostics

- **May 12, 2025**: Project initialization
  - Initial repository setup
  - Basic Stream Deck plugin structure
  - Example counter implementation
  - Documentation framework
  - Created Azure DevOps API client infrastructure
  - *(Evening)*: Removed example counter code. Reviewed API client - found implementation more complete than initially documented (includes API calls, caching, retries).
  - *(Late Evening)*: Implemented settings management system for organizations and projects. Created type definitions and SettingsManager service. Added unit tests for the new functionality.
  - *(Night)*: Fixed all lint errors by improving interface naming conventions, extracting API error handling to a separate class, and adding proper TypeScript type annotations.
  - *(Late Night)*: Disabled no-console linting rule to allow console logging during development phase, with a plan to re-enable before production release.

- **May 13, 2025**: First Feature Implementation
  - Implemented PipelineMonitor action for real-time pipeline status display
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for the PipelineMonitor action
  - Fixed type issues with Stream Deck SDK event handling
  - Achieved over 90% code coverage for the PipelineMonitor action
  - Implemented Property Inspector UI for pipeline selection
  - Updated manifest.json to include the PipelineMonitor action with PropertyInspectorPath
  - Updated project documentation to reflect current implementation

## Project Evolution

### Technical Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| May 12, 2025 | TypeScript + Rollup | Strong typing for reliability, Rollup for efficient bundling |
| May 12, 2025 | ES Modules | Modern module system with better tree-shaking |
| May 12, 2025 | SingletonAction pattern | Appropriate for stateful actions displaying Azure resources |
| May 12, 2025 | Singleton API Client | Central point for Azure DevOps communication, consistent configuration |
| May 12, 2025 | Node.js fetch API | Using built-in HTTP client to avoid additional dependencies |
| May 12, 2025 | Interface naming with 'I' prefix | Consistent naming convention for better code discoverability |
| May 12, 2025 | Single class per file | Follows SOLID principles, easier maintenance and testing |
| May 12, 2025 | Allow console logging during development | Provides helpful debug information during development phase |

### Architectural Changes

| Date | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| May 12, 2025 | Initial architecture with plugin.ts as entry point | Following Stream Deck SDK patterns |
| May 12, 2025 | Created services/ directory for API client | Separation of concerns; isolating API logic from UI components |
| May 12, 2025 | Created types/ directory for type definitions | Centralized location for TypeScript interfaces shared across components |

## Testing Status

- âœ… **Enhanced test coverage for service layer**
  - Improved overall service layer coverage from ~73% to 92.04% for statements
  - Increased function coverage from 84% to 98%
  - azureDevOpsClient.ts: 78.65% â†’ 90.85% statement coverage
  - settingsManager.ts: 61.6% â†’ 92.85% statement coverage
  - Added comprehensive tests for:
    - Retry mechanism in API client
    - Cache management and expiration
    - Error categorization and handling
    - Network errors and invalid response handling
    - Connection testing edge cases
    - Settings loading/saving error scenarios
    - Project management functionality
    - Authentication validation
- âœ… Unit tests for Settings Manager are now passing
  - Fixed state contamination issues by ensuring proper test isolation
  - Modified tests to use fresh copies of test data for each test case
- âœ… Unit tests for Azure DevOps API client are passing
  - Using mocked responses to simulate API behavior
  - Comprehensive tests for different error scenarios and edge cases
  - Isolated test execution with console output mocking for cleaner output
- âœ… Unit tests for PipelineMonitor action added
  - Tests for all core functionality: initialization, event handling, status updates
  - Proper state handling and button updates based on build status
  - Verification of polling mechanism for real-time updates
  - Mock testing for all possible pipeline states (running, success, failure, etc.)
- Jest configured to work with ES modules
- ESLint configured for code quality (`npm run lint`)
- Current code coverage: 34.21% overall (core services at 92.04%)
  - Low overall coverage due to actions (pipelineMonitor.ts, globalSettings.ts) having 0% coverage

## Performance Considerations

- Need to establish baseline performance metrics
- Monitor API call frequency and response times
- Caching strategy implemented in API client, needs verification.

## Next Milestone Goals

- Create custom icons for different pipeline states
- Develop Pull Request tracking functionality
- Enhance the configuration UI for Azure DevOps connections

## Testing Updates

- âœ… Added unit tests for the Property Inspector UI communication
  - Tests for project/pipeline data fetching and sending to the Property Inspector
  - Tests for error handling and validation in the Property Inspector interactions
  - Verified didReceiveSettings handler for updated settings from Property Inspector
