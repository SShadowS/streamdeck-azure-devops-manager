## Active Decisions & Considerations

### API Interaction Strategy

- **Decision Made**: Pull updates via polling
  - ✅ Implemented polling in the PipelineMonitor action
  - ✅ Added configurable refresh interval via settings
  - ✅ Added proper cleanup of intervals when actions disappear
  - Future Consideration: Evaluate webhooks for v2 if the polling approach has limitations

### Visual Design

- **Decision Needed**: Status representation approach
  - How to effectively communicate pipeline/PR status in limited button space
  - Need to design icons for various states (running, success, failure, etc.)
  - Consider accessibility aspects (color blindness, etc.)

### Error Handling

- **Decision Made**: Comprehensive error handling strategy
  - ✅ API client has retry logic for transient errors
  - ✅ PipelineMonitor shows "Error" status on API failures
  - ✅ PipelineMonitor shows "Disconnected" status when auth settings are invalid
  - ✅ Graceful degradation with clear visual indicators of connectivity status
  - ✅ Enhanced connection testing with detailed logging and visual feedback
  - ✅ Added "Testing connection..." indicator with spinner in the UI

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

- Each action should be in its own file under src/actions/
- Shared services should be placed in src/services/
- Common utilities in src/utils/
- Types and interfaces in dedicated files
- Interface names should follow the 'I' prefix convention (e.g., `ISettings`, not `Settings`)

### API Access Pattern

- Create a singleton API client service
- Actions should request data through this service
- Service should handle caching, authentication, and error retries

### UI Updates

- Follow the Stream Deck SDK patterns for UI updates
- Use setTitle, setImage, and setState methods consistently
- Consider throttling updates to avoid flickering

### Property Inspector Communication

- Follow the established Stream Deck communication pattern:
  - Use `sendToPropertyInspector` to send data from plugin to UI
  - Use `sendToPlugin` to send data from UI to plugin
  - Structure messages with a `command` property and relevant data
  - Handle errors and provide feedback in the UI

### Development Methodology

- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
  - Write tests before implementing features
  - Run tests continuously during development
  - Refactor code with confidence based on test coverage
- Follow SOLID principles throughout the codebase
  - Maintain single responsibility for classes and methods (max one class per file)
  - Design for extensibility without modifying existing code
  - Use appropriate abstractions and dependency injection
- Maintain code quality with linting
  - ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
  - Enforce consistent code style and best practices
  - Use proper type annotations (avoid `any`, prefer `unknown` for truly unknown types)
  - Always add explicit return types to functions

## Learnings and Insights

### Property Inspector UI Development
- Stream Deck Property Inspector uses WebSocket for communicating with the plugin
- Registration happens through the `connectElgatoStreamDeckSocket` function
- The Property Inspector is loaded in an iframe within the Stream Deck software
- CSS styling should account for the dark theme of Stream Deck
- Error handling is important for graceful degradation
- Property Inspectors can request different types of data from the plugin

- The Elgato Stream Deck SDK provides a clean event-driven architecture
- TypeScript decorators simplify action registration
- The SingletonAction base class is appropriate for most Azure DevOps monitoring scenarios
- Settings persistence is handled automatically by the Stream Deck software
- Node.js fetch API is suitable for making HTTP requests to the Azure DevOps API
- Stream Deck SDK event handlers use generics for type safety with settings
- The actions collection in SingletonAction provides access to all instances
- Proper cleanup of timers and intervals is essential in onWillDisappear handlers
- Visual status indicators need to be clear and concise on small Stream Deck buttons
- Unit testing Stream Deck actions requires careful mocking of the SDK's interfaces
