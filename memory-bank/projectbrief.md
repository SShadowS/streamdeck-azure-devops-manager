# Project Brief: Azure DevOps Manager

## Project Overview

The Azure DevOps Manager is a Stream Deck plugin designed to manage and monitor Azure DevOps Pipelines and Pull Requests. It provides a convenient interface for DevOps engineers and developers to track and interact with their Azure DevOps resources directly from their Stream Deck device.

## Core Requirements

- Enable monitoring of Azure DevOps Pipeline statuses
- Provide visibility into active Pull Requests
- Allow for quick interactions with Azure DevOps resources
- Present critical information in a glanceable format on Stream Deck buttons

## Target Users

- Software developers working with Azure DevOps
- DevOps engineers managing Azure pipelines
- Team leaders needing visibility into project status

## Current Status

- Early development phase (Version 0.1.0.0)
- Core infrastructure (API client, Settings Manager) is implemented and tested
- First functional feature (Pipeline Monitor) is implemented with comprehensive tests

## Key Features (Planned)

- Pipeline status monitoring
- PR tracking and notifications
- Quick actions for common Azure DevOps tasks
- Visual indicators for build/deployment statuses

## Technical Foundation

- Stream Deck plugin using Elgato SDK v2
- TypeScript-based implementation
- Node.js runtime (v20)

## Success Criteria

- Seamless integration with Azure DevOps services
- Intuitive representation of DevOps information on Stream Deck buttons
- Reliable performance and status updates
- Time-saving compared to using the web interface for common tasks
