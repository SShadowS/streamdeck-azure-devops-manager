# Product Context: Azure DevOps Manager

## Problem Statement

Software developers and DevOps engineers working with Azure DevOps frequently need to:

- Monitor the status of CI/CD pipelines
- Keep track of open Pull Requests
- Respond quickly to build failures or deployment issues
- Perform common Azure DevOps actions without interrupting their workflow

Checking these statuses typically requires opening a browser, navigating to the Azure DevOps portal, and clicking through multiple pages. This context-switching interrupts focus and reduces productivity.

## Solution

The Azure DevOps Manager Stream Deck plugin brings these critical DevOps functions directly to the user's fingertips via physical buttons on their Stream Deck device, enabling:

- At-a-glance visibility of pipeline statuses through color-coded buttons
- Immediate notification of PR updates or build failures
- One-touch access to common Azure DevOps actions
- Rapid context awareness without switching applications

## User Experience Goals

1. **Minimal Configuration**: Users should be able to set up their Azure DevOps connection with minimal effort
2. **Glanceability**: Status information should be instantly understandable through visual cues
3. **Actionability**: Common tasks should be executable with a single button press
4. **Customizability**: Users should be able to configure which pipelines, repositories, or PRs they want to monitor
5. **Reliability**: Status updates should be timely and accurate

## Key User Flows

1. **Pipeline Monitoring**:
   - User assigns a Stream Deck button to a specific pipeline
   - Button displays the current status (running, succeeded, failed) through color and icons
   - Pressing the button opens the pipeline details in a browser

2. **PR Management**:
   - Button shows number of open PRs or specific PR status
   - Pressing displays a list of PRs or opens a specific PR
   - Optional actions for approving/rejecting PRs directly from Stream Deck

3. **Build Triggering**:
   - Dedicated buttons for triggering specific build pipelines
   - Visual feedback on button showing when build starts

## Success Indicators

- Reduced time spent checking Azure DevOps status
- Faster response time to pipeline failures
- Fewer context switches during development
- User satisfaction with the seamless integration into their workflow
